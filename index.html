            <p>Employees may be laid off or discharged at any time for just cause.</p>
            <p>Except in cases of discharge for just cause, no A-List employee shall be laid off or discharged until all D-List, C-List and B-List employees in the same work classification have been laid off or discharged in that order, e.g. “D”, then “C”, then “B” on a job by job basis.</p>
            <p>Among other just causes, it shall be deemed just cause for an Individual Employer to discharge an employee when the Individual Employer's insurance carrier has notified him in writing or by telegram that said employee may not drive any employer-owned vehicle due to the employee’s poor DMV driving record when the driving of the employer-owned vehicle is an essential requirement to the performance of the employee’s regular job functions and copies of the writing or telegram from the insurance carrier and of the DMV record relied upon have first been made available to the Local Union's Business Manager.</p>
